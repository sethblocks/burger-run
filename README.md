## Controls

Walk with A and D, jump with space, you can also Dash by holding shift and clicking A or D while midair. Dashing uses your energy, if you don't have enough, it wont work; energy regenerates over time

## Gameplay

This is a platformer, kinda like Super Mario, You get points for going fast, killing enemies, etc.

## Development
Game engine is Godot 4.5.1, I used their GDScript language
I made the sprites using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
I also used Inkscape for a few graphics
